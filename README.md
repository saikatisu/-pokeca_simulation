 Deck probability calculator. Simulate drawing cards to calculate the probability of meeting specific conditions. Enhance your gameplay by analyzing chances of drawing key cards or winning under different circumstances.

<Goal>
The goal is to calculate the probability of having an "Achroma's Experiment" in hand when there are 8 cards in hand. The deck reference for the simulation is the "Loss Giratina Deck."
<Procedure>
Step 1: Draw 7 cards from the deck and add them to the hand.
Step 2: If a Seed Pok√©mon is drawn among the 7 cards in hand, proceed to the next step. Otherwise, return the 7 cards to the deck and go back to Step 1.
Step 3: Draw 6 cards from the deck and treat them as side cards. Then, draw 1 card from the deck and add it to the hand.
I would like to know the probability of having an "Achroma's Experiment" when there are 8 cards in hand after drawing the initial 7 cards.

<Desired Outcome>
The desired outcome is the probability of having an "Achroma's Experiment" when there are 8 cards in hand.
